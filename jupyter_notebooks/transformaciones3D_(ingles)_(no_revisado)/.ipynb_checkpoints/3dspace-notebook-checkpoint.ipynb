    "# 2D and 3D space computer graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are into computer graphics, you will notice that every graphic pipeline uses linear transformation using matrices and vectors to describe the 3D scene to be rendered. However, there are no good explanations on what these matrices are exactly, or how do they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tell you the truth, this is something that you learn along the way once you get into vectors and linear algebra. But I will try my best describing it to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector can represent a direction or a point in space. It can be used to describe the magnitude of a force and it's direction, the distance of a point in space from the origin, etc.  It can be represented geometrically using an arrow, or a point. In a one-dimensional space this would be in a straigth line. In a two dimensional space, this is inside of a plane. In a three dimensional space, this is inside of a cube (Always asuming a cartesian coordinate system). For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "![asd](1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This graphic can represent a vector (the arrow pointing to (1,1)) inside a two dimensional space (Usually represented with the symbol $ \\mathbb{R}^2 $). Each value represent the end point of the vector in this space, being $x=1$ and $y=1$, and it's origin being (0,0), which is the origin. Vectors don't necessarily have to be centered at the origin like in this case, but for the sake of simplicity let's asume they do, since in computer graphics all vectors are centered at the origin of the scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2D vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector can be described in two three ways, one is like this:\n",
    "$$v = <1,1>$$\n",
    "This tells us that this is a vector (called $v$) that points to (1,1) from the origin of the space. Each value of the vector is called a **component** of the vector, that corresponds to the corresponding axis. The generic way to represent a 2D vector would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v=<x,y>$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where x is the x component and y is the y component. I will explain the other two ways to describe a vector later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Length (norm)\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors have two main properties you need to be aware of: their **length** (also called the **norm** of the vector), and their **direction**. The length of the vector is easy to calculate, as it is the length of the line. If you remember this from geometry and trigonometry, and thinking about the vector as a *line* from the origin to the vector's end point, If we were to draw two lines (one that is horizontal crossing the initial point and another one that is vertical crossing the end point of this line) then we would have a *triangle*, and the vector line would be the hypotenuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "![asd](2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of each side of the triangle corresponds to the corresponding component of the vector. The opposite side corresponds to the y axis, and the adjacent side (the bottom leg) corresponds to the x axis. So in this case both sides are 1, and by pythagoras we know that the length of the vector is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "||v|| = \\sqrt{1^2+1^2} = \\sqrt{2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often called the **norm** of the vector, which in this case equals $\\sqrt{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "One important operation regarding vectors is the **normalization** of the vector. In this process, we are interested in obtaining a vector from another one whose direction is the same, but whose length is exactly 1. This can be achieved by multiplying each component of the vector by the reciprocal of it's norm.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u = v\\frac{1}{||v||} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in this case, a normalized vector would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "u = v\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\displaystyle{<\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}},\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}>}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure enough, if you calculate the norm of $u$, you'd get 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "||u|| = \\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2+(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})^2} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{2}} = \\sqrt{1} = 1\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Direction\n",
    "\n",
    "A vector that is not zero (that is, if the length is not zero, or if at least one of the components is non-zero) can be represented using trigonometric expressions, as long as it is in the origin of the space. Like we did earlier, we can express the vector as the hypotenuse of a triangle, and this means there is an angle ($\\phi$). So the x component corresponds to the cosine of $\\phi$, and the y component corresponds to the sine of $\\phi$. So the vector would be the product of the norm (length) times each of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = ||v|| \\displaystyle<sin \\phi, cos \\phi>$$\n",
    "\n",
    "![asd](3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit vector\n",
    "\n",
    "A unit vector is a vector whose length is exactly 1. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "î = <1,0>\\\\\n",
    "j = <0,1>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "are both unit vectors. Normalized vectors are also unit vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arithmetical operations involving vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add or subtract vectors by performing said operation among all of the components of the vectors. For instance, let v and w be two vectors, $v = <2,0>$ and $w = <1,5>$. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v+w = <2+1, 0+5> = <3, 5>\\\\\n",
    "v-w = <2-1, 0-5> = <1, -5>\\\\\n",
    "v\\pm w = <vx \\pm wx, vy \\pm wy>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Always as long as the dimensions of the vectors are the same (2 dimensions in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplications and divisions are a little bit more complicated. For now, let's just define a multiplication of a vector with a **scalar**, and leave divisions defined as a multiplication of a vector with the reciprocal of a scalar.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a little bit more to this, but let's leave it like this for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalars are constant values that are multiplied to the vector, and make them increase their length by a constant value. For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2v = <2*vx, 2*vy>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, 2 is a **scalar** of $v$, which makes $v$ grow twice as long as it's components are multiplied by two. Divisions of scalars can be achieved by multiplying by the reciprocal of the scalar:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{2}v = <\\frac{1}{2}*vx, \\frac{1}{2}*vy>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3-Dimensional vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "3 dimensional vectors ($\\mathbb{R}^3$) are the same, except they have 3 components instead of two. They work practically the same except their representation is in 3D using an axis that represents *depth*.\n",
    "\n",
    "![asd](4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This vector can be represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = <5,3,6>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or to be more specific, $x = 5, y = 3, z = 6$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confusion with the axes\n",
    "\n",
    "There can be a little bit of confusion with the axes. In 2D, the Y axis represents *height* and the x axis represents the *width*. In 3D, the Y axis represents *depth*, the x axis represents *width*, and the z axis represents *height*.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in 3D sofware like videogames and such, you will notice that it's the Y axis the one in charge of the height, while the Z axis represents the depth. In fact, the depth is calculated using a *z-buffer*, called like that because it represents the distance of each vertex from the origin of the z axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just to make computer graphics more intuitive. Your graphic pipeline must represent (also called a *projection*) a 3D space in a 2D surface, which is your screen. Because this screen is 2D, it's height corresponds to the Y axis and the width corresponds to the X axis. So in the 3D space we use the Y axis and X axis for height and width, and the z axis for the depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The other two ways to represent a vector\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I left the other two ways to represent a vector for the last thing. We know that one way would be like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v = <5,3,6>$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second way is using a *linear combination* of each of it's component, times the unit vector corresponsing to that component. Remember that the unit vectors are vectors of length 1 like these:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "î = <1,0,0>\\\\\n",
    "j = <0,1,0>\\\\\n",
    "k = <0,0,1>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So a vector $v = <5,3,6>$ can be represented like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "5î + 3j + 6k \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which is the same but represented as a linear combination. And the last way to represent a vector, is using a *matrix*. It can be represented as either a row vector, or a column vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "v = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}5&3&6  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}5\\\\3\\\\6  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In these examples, $v$ would be a *row vector* and $w$ would be a *column vector*. In 3D graphics, vectors are normally represented as a column vector, though some operations might use row vectors instead. Normally to represent parametric surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still alive after all this complicated math, I regret to inform you that we're only half way there. There is still much more! And be aware, this is actually the *abridged version*. Now comes the important part!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices are collections of numbers or variables organized in boxes of a specified size ($nxm$). In the previous section you've met two matrices, being $v$ a 1x3 matrix and $w$ a 3x1 matrix. You guessed it, it's *rows times columns*. You can use them to solve systems of linear equations, but they can also be used to calculate *linear transformations*, among many other uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about matrices is that there is *a lot* about them and they are usually covered in linear algebra. A linear algebra book might be about 500+ pages covering all this stuff in depth, so I'll do my best to resume just what you need to know right now about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic operations\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that a matrix is a collection of numbers, could be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}2 & 4 & 6\\\\1 & 3 & 5\\\\2 & 3 & 4  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case A is a 3x3 matrix. This is, 3 rows and 3 columns. There are three basic operations you can perform on a matrix, those are called *elemental operations*. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Switching rows. For instance, switch the first row with the second row (doesn't need to be in any particular order, you can switch them at free will).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 3 & 5\\\\2 & 4 & 6\\\\2 & 3 & 4  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Adding or subtracting a constant number of times one row to another. For instance, we can add the first row -2 times to the second row. The number of times doesn't have to be an integer, it can be any real number. Adding by a negative number of times results in a subtraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 3 & 5\\\\0 & -2 & -4\\\\2 & 3 & 4  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multiplying a row by a scalar. For instance, multiplying the second row by $-\\frac{1}{2}$. Again, the scalar can be any scalar:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 3 & 5\\\\0 & 1 & 2\\\\2 & 3 & 4  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples showcased here had these operations performed in the specified order. Naturally, those operations can be performed in any order, any number of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Row Echelon Form (ref)\n",
    "\n",
    "The resultant matrix from the previous operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 3 & 5\\\\0 & 1 & 2\\\\2 & 3 & 4  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Could be represented in ref if we perform the following operations to it: adding the first row to the last one -2 times, and adding the second row to the last 3 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 3 & 5\\\\0 & 1 & 2\\\\0 & 0 & 0  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why we know this matrix is in *row echelon form*? Well, it has three properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each row has a leading 1. Every value that is not a 1 at the left side, is a zero.\n",
    "2. Every subsecuent row that has a leading 1, have their leading 1 at the right of the previous row.\n",
    "3. If there is a row that has no leading 1, it is at the bottom of the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a matrix at least the first two properties (or all of them), then we say it's in row echelon form.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reduced row echelon form (rref)\n",
    "\n",
    "A reduced row echelon matrix has the same properties as a row echelon matrix, and one more property:\n",
    "\n",
    "4. When a column has a 1, every other value at that column must be a zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, a reduced row echelon matrix could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\0 & 1 & 0&0\\\\0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\0&0&0&0  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\displaystyle{\\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 \\\\0 & 1 & 0\\\\0 & 0 & 1  \\end{bmatrix}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrix arithmetics\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrices can be added or subtracted, but only **if their sizes are the same**. For example, you can add two matrices that are 3x4 together, but you can not add a matrix that is 3x4 with another one that is 4x2 because their sizes do not match. The result is a matrix with all the elements added together.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Product of matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "You can multiply two matrices, but only if the number of columns of the matrix at the left is equal to the number of rows of the matrix at the right. The resultant matrix is another matrix with the number of rows of the matrix at the right, and the number of columns of the matrix at the left.\n",

    "Note that I called `glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW)` to specify that I want to use the Model view matrix for the following operations. By default, this matrix is set to a 4x4 identity matrix. Then I call `glTranslatef(1.5f, 0.0f, -7.0f);` to move the object somewhere in front of the viewport so it can be rendered. Then I describe two objects, one being a cube, and another one being a pyramid. Those go between calls to `glBegin(GL_QUADS)` and `glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES)` respectively, and `glEnd()` to specify where the drawing ends. Each contains calls to `glVertex3f(x,y,z)` to describe each vertex in the geometry of the object.\n",
